== Planed features
=== display all medicine to be taken during the chosen timespan (can be changed with a calendar button or something similar)

=== Display if the user
* missed a medicine intake (displayed with a red color)
* should still take the medicine but is within the allowed time frame (displayed with a yellow color)
* has already taken the medicine (displayed with a green color)

=== send a notification
* to the device of the user if the intake was missed
* to a contact person if the user still didn't take the medicine even after the first notification
* to whoever is registered as next person (usually a doctor) if the user still didn't take the medicine after the contact person was contacted



== Current work in progress
* basic Dashboard with MQTT connection
* configuring logic behind colors
