= Commit guidelines

We use the conventional commits guidelines from the following website
link:https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[conventional commits website]

== the most important guidelines are the following
* fix: when patching a bug
* feat: when a new feature is added
* docs: when adding or changing documents
* chore: cleaning the repository (removing unnecessary files)

a possible commit could look like this:
----
docs: added commit guidelines file
----

== Youtrack integration
in our case we also have to add the hashcode of the Youtrack task. If the task has the hashcode "cura-4", then the commit will look like the following:
----
docs: added commit guidelines file #cura-4
----
